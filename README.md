State governments and public health agencies have begun recommending that schools implement "Physically Distanced Learning," with a student/teacher ratio of 10/1 or fewer in each classroom. At most schools, this will require rotating groups of students into the school building while other students stay home and learn remotely. This project aims to help schools assign students to an A/B/C/D group in a manner that allows physical distancing in as many classrooms as possible. Video introduction: https://youtu.be/XJFvY4-FCSc
